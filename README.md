📊 Customer Behavior Analysis

🔹 Project Overview
This project performs a Customer Behavior Analysis to gain insights into customer purchasing patterns, discounts, subscription behavior, and product preferences. The goal was to build an end-to-end data pipeline: from raw dataset → cleaning → SQL database → analysis → visualization in Power BI.

🔹 Project Workflow

1️⃣ Data Collection
- The dataset was downloaded from a publicly available source.
- It contains customer details such as age, gender, items purchased, purchase amount, discounts, subscription status, and more.

2️⃣ Data Cleaning
- The raw dataset was cleaned using Python and Pandas in a Jupyter Notebook.
- Cleaning steps included:
  - Handling missing values
  - Formatting columns
  - Preparing the dataset for SQL import

3️⃣ SQL Database
- The cleaned data was imported into MySQL to create a database called `customer_behavior`.
- Using the MySQL command-line client, the following 10 analysis questions were executed using SQL queries:

🔹 Analysis Questions
1️⃣ Total revenue generated by male vs. female customers  
2️⃣ Customers who used a discount but spent more than the average purchase amount  
3️⃣ Top 5 products with the highest average review rating  
4️⃣ Compare average purchase amounts between Standard and Express Shipping  
5️⃣ Compare average spend and total revenue for subscribed vs. non-subscribed customers  
6️⃣ Top 5 products with the highest percentage of purchases with discounts applied  
7️⃣ Segment customers into New, Returning, and Loyal based on previous purchases  
8️⃣ Top 3 most purchased products within each category  
9️⃣ Are repeat buyers (more than 5 previous purchases) likely to subscribe?  
🔟 Revenue contribution of each age group  

4️⃣ Power BI Visualization
- Connected Power BI to the SQL database.
- Created a new column for age groups using DAX formula.
- Built visual dashboards and insights.
- Saved the Power BI report file (.pbix) and exported dashboard screenshots.
